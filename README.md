# EPL-Sentiment-Analysis-Visualizations
This repository includes my analysis of the sentiment scores on the three teams: Chelsea, Manchester Unity, and Manchester City

Two sets of files:
a. A Dataset that has complete sentiment scores. This is computed by the extraction of twitter data using R.
b. The data is visualized using Tableau 10.4
